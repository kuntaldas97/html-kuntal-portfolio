<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kuntal Das. I am from Paschim Medinipur, West Bengal, India. I have completed my schooling from P.R.C.S.S.M. 
  I have completed My Diploma and B-tech in Mechanical Engineering from R.I.S.T and E.C.E respectively.
Also I have done a industrial training in railway air compressor of WDME3A from STC, Kharagpur.Besides I have done two courses on Autocad and SolidWorks
from Techhub Solution, Jadavpur.</p>
<p>At the end of my B-tech I felt so much interest in coding. And after completing a course in Java, my intensity of learnig coding was increased
  enormously. And finally I decided to switch from Mechanical to It. In further future I have a keen interest to work on these sectors like web3,
BlockChain, Crypto etc.</p>
<p>Besides Studying I love to play Badminton and listening to Music. If you are talking about my strength then I am a cool minded person who can do
both hard work and smart work. And if you are talking about my weakness then I can say that I trust people easily which sometimes brings trouble.</p>
<p>Finally! I always believe that whatever you do in your life but never forget to become a good human being.</p>
